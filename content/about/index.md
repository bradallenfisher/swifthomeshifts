# About Me
### Hi, I’m Grant Garab…

I am the proud co-owner of WeAreHomeBuyers.com. As a retired Marine, I devoted over sixteen years of my life to serving our great country. In 2019, my life took an unexpected turn when I was involved in a head-on collision with a texting teenager while riding my motorcycle home from work…

## Then What Happened?

This near-fatal accident profoundly altered my perspective on career goals for both myself and my family.

While confined to a wheelchair for over eight months and undergoing more than a dozen surgeries, I used my downtime to contemplate the next chapter in my life, considering the future of my wife of fifteen years and our three sons.

With retirement from the Marine Corps on the horizon and years of experience assisting homeowners with their unwanted properties as a side job, I decided to establish WeAreHomeBuyers.com.
