## Understanding Judgment Liens in Real Estate Sales

When it comes to selling a home, the existence of a lien can complicate the process considerably. A lien is a legal claim or hold on a piece of property, which can arise from unpaid debts that the property owner owes to creditors. Specifically, a judgment lien emerges after a court awards a financial judgment to a creditor and becomes an involuntary lien on the owner's property, including real estate.

### The Impact of a Lien on Selling Your House

A **house with a lien** against it carries the weight of debt, which can present challenges when you decide to **sell your home**. Potential buyers typically avoid entanglements that could affect their ownership rights, making it crucial for sellers to address liens promptly. Selling a **home with a lien** is indeed possible, but it calls for a thorough understanding of the type of lien and the steps necessary to resolve it.
