**Home prices** have experienced significant fluctuations, riding the wave of the pandemic-driven boom, and settling down as **mortgage rates** escalated. This has created a diverse market that varies significantly from region to region.

### Housing Bubble and its Burst

Reports from organizations like the **National Association of Realtors (NAR)** suggest that **existing home sales** have tempered compared to the fervent pace seen in previous years. This cooling is a direct result of affordability challenges and could indicate a shifting market dynamic.
