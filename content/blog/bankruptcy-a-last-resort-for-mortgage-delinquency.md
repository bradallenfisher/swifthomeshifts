  - Seek assistance from a real estate agent experienced in short sales.
  - For a **mortgage modification**, you must apply through your lender and provide evidence of **financial hardship**.

It is imperative to exhaust all other remedies—**forbearance**, **refinancing**, **loan modification**, and **repayment plans**—before considering the plunge into bankruptcy.
